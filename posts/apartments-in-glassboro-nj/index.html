One of the most important things that residents should do when living in an apartment complex is to be aware of their surroundings. This way, they can avoid being alone in unfamiliar areas and/or being approached by someone who may want to harm them. Additionally, it is important to beaware of any hidden dangers that may exist inside an apartment complex.</p><h2 id=the-plaza-grande-at-garden-state-park-55-apartments---cherry-hill-nj>The Plaza Grande At Garden State Park 55+ Apartments - Cherry Hill, NJ<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-plaza-grande-at-garden-state-park-55-apartments---cherry-hill-nj>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/Ort2ryQN5yqtDBseS78L8mFxDirESLdL2bDkAfaBqXc/111/the-plaza-grande-at-garden-state-park-55-cherry-hill-nj-primary-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.sKRI8LOTyghItOKM_ww4nQHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="The Plaza Grande at Garden State Park 55+ Apartments - Cherry Hill, NJ"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>plaza state garden cherry grande hill apartments park nj.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments have been around for a long time, and even though they vary in cost and amenities, they are becoming increasingly popular in the city.
