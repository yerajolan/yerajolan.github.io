A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=city-life-milan--zaha-hadid-architects--archello>City Life Milan | Zaha Hadid Architects | Archello<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#city-life-milan--zaha-hadid-architects--archello>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://archello.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images/2016/03/15/ZahaHadidMilan06SG16119203.1506070926.674.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KHDXBwKzyy8q9ROTJv8T7wHaE9&pid=15.1"' alt="City Life Milan | Zaha Hadid Architects | Archello"><p><em>Source: archello.com</em></p><blockquote><p>zaha hadid citylife milan milano residential complex architects project apartments housing archdaily simón arquitectura archello architect buildings curved garcia office.</p></blockquote><p>What are apartments?
