Apartments can be subdivided into two types: single and multi-family. Single family apartments typically have one bedroom and one bathroom, while multi-family apartments may have up to four bedrooms and up to four bathrooms. In order to make the most of a space, it’s important to think about what items will need to be in each room in order to function comfortably. When looking for an apartment, it’s important to focus on the living areas first. A kitchen is a vital part of any apartment, and should include everything you need for cooking food (pots, pans, utensils, etc.), as well as storage space for your dishes and cookware.
