Apartments provide a variety of benefits to tenants. These benefits can include:</p><ol><li><p>Reduced rent costs: A landlord can reduce their monthly rent by providing an apartment. This is because an apartment is larger and more expensive than a rental unit that is not an apartment.</p></li><li><p>Increased security: With apartments, tenants have more potential peace of mind knowing that the building has a locksmith and 24-hour security. This increased security can make it difficult for anyone to break into an apartment.</p></li><li><p>More affordable living space: If an apartment is large enough, it may be cheaper to live in one than in multiple rental units. This is because each individual tenant pays only a portion of the monthly rent, which means that landlords are free to charge whatever they want for their units.</p></li></ol><h2 id=1-bedroom-apartments-austin-tx--pool-time-with-images--downtown>1 Bedroom Apartments Austin Tx / Pool Time!

The first is that the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the city can be as high as $2,000, so factor that into your budget before looking at other options.
