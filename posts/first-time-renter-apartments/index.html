The minimum requirements for apartments vary depending on the city or town in which they are located. In some cases, the apartment must have an entrance, a balcony or other outdoor space, and be able to hold at least four people.
In other cases, the apartment may only require one or two bedrooms, with kitchen and bathroom facilities being included.
There is no set threshold as to how much money someone must pay to live in an apartment, but most places require a deposit and periodic rent payments.</p><h2 id=399-east-78th-street---nyc-apartments--cityrealty>399 East 78th Street - NYC Apartments | CityRealty<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#399-east-78th-street---nyc-apartments--cityrealty>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://ds1.cityrealty.com/img/07129035cc88c3921abeb3b1c93f5024c8994d13+w+h+0+60/399-east-78th-street-00.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.CjlsmYNsf0H9Cs6Wxw0LPQAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="399 East 78th Street - NYC Apartments | CityRealty"><p><em>Source: cityrealty.com</em></p><blockquote><p>78th east street cityrealty lenox hill.</p></blockquote><p>The History of Apartments: From Slum to Luxury
