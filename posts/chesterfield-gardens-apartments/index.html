The study by the city’s Department of Planning and Development found that, from 2007 to 2016, the average rate of apartment occupancy decreased from 82 percent to 70 percent. The report also found that the number of units in an apartment building has not kept up with the growth in the city. In 2007, there were 4,711 units in an apartment building; by 2016, there were only 2,856 units.\nThe decrease in occupancy is likely due to many factors including increasingly high rent prices and a lack of available units. Additionally, there is a lack of cultural diversity in most apartments – which can be seen in the vacancy rates. In 2016, only 36 percent of units were occupied by people who identify as Spanish or Latino according to Census data.\nlooking for Green Park Gardens Apartments - Saint Louis, MO | Apartments.com you’ve visit to the right page.
