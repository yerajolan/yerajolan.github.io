A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=haverhill-ma--historic-downtown-district-photo-picture-image>Haverhill, MA : Historic Downtown District Photo, Picture, Image<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#haverhill-ma--historic-downtown-district-photo-picture-image>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://pics4.city-data.com/cpicv/vfiles23635.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.NUDi09NhkKnwZFAUfqI31QHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Haverhill, MA : Historic Downtown District photo, picture, image"><p><em>Source: city-data.com</em></p><blockquote><p>haverhill ma downtown massachusetts historic district data junk removal.</p></blockquote><p>4 bedroom apartments:
