The largest apartment sizes were found in California, with an average size of 4,200 square feet. In addition, the average apartment size in Texas was 2,500 square feet. The findings of the study are significant because they may help to change how people think about apartments and their potentialities as a space to live.</p><h2 id=old-and-new-apartments-compared-which-one-is-the-better-buy>Old And New Apartments Compared: Which One Is The Better Buy?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#old-and-new-apartments-compared-which-one-is-the-better-buy>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://res.akamaized.net/domain/image/upload/t_web/v1556598063/2015116888_8_1_190402_041806-w4600-h3067_ry92aa.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.8hRIdGbO2ZGZt8HafXe6JgHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Old and new apartments compared: Which one is the better buy?"><p><em>Source: domain.com.au</em></p><blockquote><p>apartments compared better which depreciation higher benefits come.</p></blockquote><p>Maintenance costs:
