A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=old-shelby-high-apartments---shelbyville-in--apartmentscom>Old Shelby High Apartments - Shelbyville, IN | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#old-shelby-high-apartments---shelbyville-in--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images1.apartments.com/i2/i1B28bM1ZBxPmj-m2OaovXGBr3EdzAQS682RxO1SwbQ/117/old-shelby-high-apartments-shelbyville-in-exterior.jpg?p=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.JFOO7rCBwc-m5vqVx0uwfgHaD6&pid=15.1"' alt="Old Shelby High Apartments - Shelbyville, IN | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>shelbyville.</p></blockquote><p>Area of an apartment:

Homelessness and apartment homelessness are two issues that face homelessness organizations all over the United States. In 2013, there were an estimated 45,000 homeless people living in apartments. Additionally, as homeless populations continue to grow, so too do the rates of apartment homelessness.
The problem with apartment homelessness is that it can be difficult for people who are homeless to find a place to live. Often, landlords do not consider people who are homeless when making decisions about how to manage their property. This leaves homeless people without any options other than sleeping on the streets or in shelters.</p><p>In addition to being difficult for those who are Homeless to find places to sleep, apartments also provide little opportunity for those who are experiencing poverty or low income. When someone is living in an apartment without any food or shelter, it can be difficult for them to access necessary services like healthcare and education.</p><h2 id=apartments-in-shelbyville-in--martin-estates--photo-gallery>Apartments In Shelbyville, IN | Martin Estates | Photo Gallery<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apartments-in-shelbyville-in--martin-estates--photo-gallery>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://resource.rentcafe.com/image/upload/f_auto/f_auto,q_auto,c_limit,h_1420,w_1420/s3/2/106385/shelbyville-indiana-200677.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.wPDT0SjOS5hZ_HIV8K7jXAHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Apartments in Shelbyville, IN | Martin Estates | Photo Gallery"><p><em>Source: martinestatesapts.com</em></p><blockquote><p>shelbyville 2301.</p></blockquote><p>What are the benefits of living in an apartment?
