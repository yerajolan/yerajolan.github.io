-A landlord is not limited to one type of apartment, and can evict a tenant for any reason.
-If an apartment is not fit for habitation, the landlord can sell it to another tenant or demolish it.
-Apartments are usually divided into two categories: &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; and &ldquo;floating.&rdquo; Fixed apartments are typically rented out month-to-month, while floating apartments allow for monthly rent but may also be available for lease or purchase.
Tenants who live in fixed apartments should be aware that they can&rsquo;t move out unless they get a new lease or break their current lease.</p><h2 id=matador-north-apartments---lexington-ky-40511>Matador North Apartments - Lexington, KY 40511<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#matador-north-apartments---lexington-ky-40511>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://rentpath-res.cloudinary.com/w_370,h_370,t_rp,cs_tinysrgb,fl_force_strip,c_fill/e_unsharp_mask:50,q_auto/f334e45c98c4ea99606bd10870f185cf onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.JPto3xpDQDnY8_O5C5SoJgAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Matador North Apartments - Lexington, KY 40511"><p><em>Source: apartmentguide.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>What to look for when choosing an apartment
