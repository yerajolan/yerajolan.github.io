A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years.
