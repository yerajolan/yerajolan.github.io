Here are six tips to help make the decision:</p><ol><li><p>Measure your needs: When measuring your needs, it&rsquo;s important to take into account what kind of living space you&rsquo;ll be using and how much space you&rsquo;ll have within your budget. A one-bedroom apartment might not be enough for someone who wants a lot of extra storage space, while a two-bedroom might fit more people comfortably.</p></li><li><p>Compare prices: It&rsquo;s also important to compare prices before signing a lease. Different areas have different rent rates and may require a higher or lower down payment than others.</p></li></ol><h2 id=rochester-section-8-rentals--section-8-apartment-for-rent-in-rochester>Rochester Section 8 Rentals | Section 8 Apartment For Rent In Rochester<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rochester-section-8-rentals--section-8-apartment-for-rent-in-rochester>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://hellosection8.com/timthumb.php?src=https://hellosection8.com/images/housing/11/02/04/lifetimeassistanceinc541islandcottagerdrochesterny14612-65866.jpg&w=650" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Vog--lYoVhxieWD9uZ1wggHaE6&pid=15.1"' alt="Rochester Section 8 Rentals | Section 8 Apartment for Rent in Rochester"><p><em>Source: hellosection8.com</em></p><blockquote><p>rochester.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments can be a great place to live, but they come with a lot of costs.
