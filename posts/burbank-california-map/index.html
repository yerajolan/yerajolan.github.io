The terms &ldquo;rent&rdquo; and &ldquo;lease&rdquo; are often used interchangeably when talking about rental rates, but there are important distinctions to make. Renting an apartment generally means that you will be living in it for an entire period of time- usually between one and six months. Leases on the other hand, can be for a shorter or longer period- typically one to three years.
Most apartments these days come with some type of agreement in place in order to ensure that you will be living in them for at least the minimum length of time required by the lease.</p><h2 id=burbank-california-wall-map-premium-style-by-marketmaps>Burbank California Wall Map (Premium Style) By MarketMAPS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#burbank-california-wall-map-premium-style-by-marketmaps>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.mapsales.com/map-images/superzoom/marketmaps/city/Premium/Burbank_CA.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.0K7rCDxwjdDrs2iwaOD0pQHaJ4&pid=15.1"' alt="Burbank California Wall Map (Premium Style) by MarketMAPS"><p><em>Source: mapsales.com</em></p><blockquote><p>burbank marketmaps.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a type of housing which can be found in many different shapes and sizes.

A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=best-places-to-live-in-burbank-california-1>Best Places To Live In Burbank, California<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-places-to-live-in-burbank-california-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://www.bestplaces.net/images/city/0608968_CA_Burbank.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.RtHbxyGAKDeH_dS_36tsZAHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="Best Places to Live in Burbank, California"><p><em>Source: bestplaces.net</em></p><blockquote><p>burbank california map.</p></blockquote><p>What are the different types of apartments?
