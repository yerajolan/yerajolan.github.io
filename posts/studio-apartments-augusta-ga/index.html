Apartments provide a variety of benefits to tenants. These benefits can include:</p><ol><li><p>Reduced rent costs: A landlord can reduce their monthly rent by providing an apartment. This is because an apartment is larger and more expensive than a rental unit that is not an apartment.</p></li><li><p>Increased security: With apartments, tenants have more potential peace of mind knowing that the building has a locksmith and 24-hour security. This increased security can make it difficult for anyone to break into an apartment.</p></li><li><p>More affordable living space: If an apartment is large enough, it may be cheaper to live in one than in multiple rental units. This is because each individual tenant pays only a portion of the monthly rent, which means that landlords are free to charge whatever they want for their units.</p></li></ol><h2 id=bon-air-apartments-apartments---augusta-ga--apartmentscom>Bon Air Apartments Apartments - Augusta, GA | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bon-air-apartments-apartments---augusta-ga--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/qVgK6vEBX3J7xrdGnv1JRn-bQRalCTlG-jAyoE-yneE/117/bon-air-apartments-augusta-ga-primary-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.UoMzL42KlWBAf_Y4495yhgHaD9&pid=15.1"' alt="Bon Air Apartments Apartments - Augusta, GA | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>augusta.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a type of housing which is typically provided by public or private entities.
