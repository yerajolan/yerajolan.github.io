This can include checking in on residents, cleaning up after meals, and maintaining utilities. The biggest benefit to TIP landlords is that they typically have a much longer lease term than other types of landlord, making sure that tenants stay with them for as long as possible.</p></li><li><p>roommates only: These landlords allow tenants to live together but do notrent out the entire unit.instead, each tenant rents out a specific portion of their room or suite.</p></li></ol><h2 id=coquina-condominiums7900-a1a-south-st-augustine-florida>Coquina Condominiums,7900 A1A South, St. Augustine, Florida<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#coquina-condominiums7900-a1a-south-st-augustine-florida>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://www.st-augustine-condo.com/Coquina-Condos/op-wf-DSC_0257.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.DT27G2wxJAqS3_nphUGu7gHaE6&pid=15.1"' alt="Coquina Condominiums,7900 A1A South, St. Augustine, Florida"><p><em>Source: st-augustine-condo.com</em></p><blockquote><p>condominiums coquina condos augustine st ocean beach oceanfront.</p></blockquote><p>Amenities and services available in apartment buildings: fromOn the go meal delivery to heated pool
