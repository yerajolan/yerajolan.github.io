First, make sure the building you&rsquo;re interested in is one that is close to public transportation. This will help avoid having to walk or take a bus to get to your next job or place of residence. Additionally, be sure that the apartments you&rsquo;re interested in have air conditioning and cable TV. These items can be very helpful during hotter days or during colder months.</p><p>Another thing you should consider is the size of the apartment. Make sure it&rsquo;s big enough for your family and your needs.
