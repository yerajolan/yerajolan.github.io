These buildings were known as “uan” or “lan”, and they consisted of a series of interconnected rooms.
As apartment buildings became more common in the modern world, they began to receive a number of different modifications. Some of these changes included the addition of balconies and other overlooks for residents to enjoy views from their homes.
