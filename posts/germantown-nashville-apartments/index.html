If you&rsquo;re looking for a place to call your own, an apartment may be the answer. In fact, according to a report from apartment research site RENTCafé, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in America is $2,451 per month – which works out to be just over $30 per day. And while it may seem like an expensive proposition, there are plenty of ways to save on rent without moving out of your comfort zone.
For one, consider sleeping in your own bed instead of sharing a bedroom with someone else. Not only does this make living alone more affordable, but it also allows you to get more done in a shorter amount of time – meaning you can spend more time with loved ones.</p><h2 id=new-kids-on-the-block-the-brand-new-nashville-apartments-on-our-radar>New Kids On The Block: The Brand-New Nashville Apartments On Our Radar<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#new-kids-on-the-block-the-brand-new-nashville-apartments-on-our-radar>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://blog.apartminty.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/broadstone-germantown-apartments-nashville-1.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.h1DZsJbjRAPv_R4cwppPPAHaEc&pid=15.1"' alt="New Kids On The Block: The Brand-New Nashville Apartments On Our Radar"><p><em>Source: blog.apartminty.com</em></p><blockquote><p>germantown broadstone apartminty.</p></blockquote><p>How much should you pay for an apartment?
When it comes to apartments, it really depends on what you&rsquo;re looking for. If you&rsquo;re only looking for a place to stay for a few months or if you&rsquo;re only looking for a place to live permanently, then the cost of an apartment shouldn&rsquo;t really matter too much. However, if you have long-term plans in mind and are looking to live in an apartment that will last you for years, then it&rsquo;s worth paying more.</p><h2 id=city-house---463-photos-amp-590-reviews---italian---1222-4th-ave-n>City House - 463 Photos & 590 Reviews - Italian - 1222 4th Ave N<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#city-house---463-photos-amp-590-reviews---italian---1222-4th-ave-n>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lpUYZrVhtM19Qz1sJYLPFA/168s.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.hsGxTBjcxSXk6VpoLuuh4AAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="City House - 463 Photos & 590 Reviews - Italian - 1222 4th Ave N"><p><em>Source: yelp.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>What are apartments and why are they so popular?
