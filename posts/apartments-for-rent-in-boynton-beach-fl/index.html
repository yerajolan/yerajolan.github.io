A few notable examples from throughout history include the Star-Kist Building in New York City, which was built in 1907 as a luxury hotel. Additionally, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in London was one of the first buildings to be occupied by tenants with apartments on top.</p><p>In recent years, apartment buildings have become even more popular, with many people looking for an affordable lifestyle closer to their work or home.</p><h2 id=delray-station-rentals---delray-beach-fl--apartmentscom>Delray Station Rentals - Delray Beach, FL | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#delray-station-rentals---delray-beach-fl--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/AsNR9WuBurAoOm_Se8FHDnVHsJ2ZUmPpuCXSu5qadfo/110/delray-station-delray-beach-fl-primary-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.DAFPsIRBQ6zsS4jyAXEt5AHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="Delray Station Rentals - Delray Beach, FL | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>delray station apartments beach fl wood.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments provide a place to call home, whether it is for a short period of time or for an extended period of time.

As apartment landlords, you know that being secure and privacy-conscious is important in any building. But what about when someone is inside your building?
There are a few things that you can do to make sure your guests are safe and comfortable while they&rsquo;re in your building. One is to make sure all doors and windows are locked when they&rsquo;re not allowed in. Another is to install security cameras in your building, so you can see who&rsquo;s coming or going and make sure they&rsquo;re not causing damage.</p><p>Finally, be careful about who you let into your building. Make sure you have a list of people who have been approved by the police or other security forces before letting them into the building.
