Now that you know the pros and cons of renting an apartment, what are your decisions to make? Here are some answers to some of the most common questions about renting an apartment.</p><ol><li>Pros:
• You can save on your rent by finding a place to live that is part of a community or supportive group.
• Your landlords might be more likely to renew your lease if they know you&rsquo;re involved in a community or support group.
• You can get a good deal on an apartment with a short lease term.
2 Cons:
• You may have to leave your job when you move in and miss out on important benefits like health insurance and pensions.
• Sometimes apartments are not as clean or well-maintained as they seem on the surface.</li><li>What should I look for when choosing an apartment?</li></ol><h2 id=condos-for-rent-in-greenville-sc--apartmentscom>Condos For Rent In Greenville SC | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#condos-for-rent-in-greenville-sc--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/-99fqa7vG31SgUmbyr6bz_FO4DigtuuPg5RMTSeJbdA/115/image.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.kX0Ho01VNIbp3yc6LwXFSQAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Condos for Rent in Greenville SC | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>greenville condos apartments sc rent.</p></blockquote><p>Maintenance: How often do apartment complexes need to be maintenance-ed, and how much should landlords expect tenants to pay for such services?
A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=cheap-apartments-in-greenville-south-carolina-pest-allow--where-to>Cheap Apartments In Greenville South Carolina Pest Allow / Where To<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cheap-apartments-in-greenville-south-carolina-pest-allow--where-to>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/ibimg/www.apartmentratings.com/650x350_85-1/9/9/1/99108983887411810510510479.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.453d60iH1Cke2qKhzmv-7QHaD_&pid=15.1"' alt="Cheap Apartments In Greenville South Carolina Pest Allow / Where to"><p><em>Source: foursoftgun.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>greenville cimg8.</p></blockquote><p>Residents’ rights and responsibilities:
Residents of apartments have a lot of rights and responsibilities when it comes to their living environment. Some of these rights include the right to privacy, the right to be heard in any disputes, the right to clean and disinfect your apartment, and the right to have your apartment inspected by an inspector.
Some responsibilities that apartments must take into account when it comes to Residents’ rights are the responsibility of landlords to act in good faith when making decisions about who can live in their building, tenants to make sure they are living in a safe and healthy building, landlords to approve changes that may affect Residents’ safety or wellbeing, and apartment managers should be attentive to Resident needs and concerns.</p><h2 id=downtown-greenville-condominiums--real-estate-scorecard-1>Downtown Greenville Condominiums | Real Estate Scorecard<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#downtown-greenville-condominiums--real-estate-scorecard-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://realestatescorecard.com/sites/default/files/styles/community_review_slideshow/public/Greenville_SC_Main_Street_0.jpg?itok=AUk0ZRUN" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SbzuKM3RI58fon1A9QFwdAHaDm&pid=15.1"' alt="Downtown Greenville Condominiums | Real Estate Scorecard"><p><em>Source: realestatescorecard.com</em></p><blockquote><p>greenville sc downtown main street carolina south condominiums realestatescorecard community.</p></blockquote><p>One bedroom apartments:
