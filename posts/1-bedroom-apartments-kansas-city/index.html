Here are three tips for keeping your apartment safe:</p><ol><li>Keep your door locked when you leave and when you come back in. This will help protect yourself and your belongings from thieves.</li><li>Make sure your apartment is well-lit at all times. This will make it easier for anyone who may be looking for you while you&rsquo;re away.</li><li>Keep your windows closed and never leave your door open if you have a dog or cat. This will help keep them safe from getting into trouble while you&rsquo;re away.</li></ol><h2 id=kansas-city-one-bedroom-apartment-for-rent---410--mac-properties>Kansas City One Bedroom Apartment For Rent - 410 | Mac Properties<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#kansas-city-one-bedroom-apartment-for-rent---410--mac-properties>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://www.macapartments.com/servlet/servlet.FileDownload?file=00P6e00001QpNi5EAF" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.fHxcrfPvHrnLf10932g_ZAHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Kansas City One Bedroom Apartment For Rent - 410 | Mac Properties"><p><em>Source: macapartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>rooftops leasingkc.</p></blockquote><p>Loft apartments:

These units are typically used as studios or as transitional housing for lower-income residents.</p><p>Two-bedroom apartments offer two bedrooms and a bathroom. These units are typically used as apartments for married couples or families with children.
2 3 4 bed apartments offer three bedrooms and a bathroom each.
