In some cases, landlords may also be willing to waive late payment fees if tenants make good on their rent early.</p><h2 id=stunning-20-million-new-york-city-apartment-is-mesmorising---gtspirit>Stunning $20 Million New York City Apartment Is Mesmorising - GTspirit<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#stunning-20-million-new-york-city-apartment-is-mesmorising---gtspirit>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://gtspirit.com/wp-content/gallery/gallery-stunning-new-york-city-penthouse/80909298.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.0QqgGchyhZOfEhfauGkfrQEvDO&pid=15.1"' alt="Stunning $20 Million New York City Apartment Is Mesmorising - GTspirit"><p><em>Source: gtspirit.com</em></p><blockquote><p>penthouse york apartment garage sky million ny stunning 11th nyc ave eleventh avenue buildings urban interior exceptional views manhattan living.</p></blockquote><p>Benefits of apartments over houses
