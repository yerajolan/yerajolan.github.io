When it comes to apartments, there are a few main options on the market. Some people might prefer urban living, while others may prefer suburban living. There are a variety of apartment types available, depending on what someone is looking for. For example, a studio apartment could be used for someone who only needs one room and is not interested in having a full sized home. Alternatively, an apartment with a courtyard could be perfect for someone who wants to live near nature but doesn&rsquo;t want to live in an urban area. All of these apartments have their own pros and cons, so it&rsquo;s important to decide what type of apartment is right for you.</p><h2 id=100-best-apartments-in-los-angeles-ca-with-reviews--rentcafé>100 Best Apartments In Los Angeles, CA (with Reviews) | RENTCafé<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#100-best-apartments-in-los-angeles-ca-with-reviews--rentcafé>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://cdngeneral.rentcafe.com/dmslivecafe/3/108088/3_108088_2288833.jpg?width=380" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bB2sl-Sla982pyARm6qK-wAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="100 Best Apartments in Los Angeles, CA (with reviews) | RENTCafé"><p><em>Source: rentcafe.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>appeal of apartments: from convenience tostyle
