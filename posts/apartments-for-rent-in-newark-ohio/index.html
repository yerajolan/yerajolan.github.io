Maintenance is key in keeping an apartment clean. Here are three tips to help:</p><ol><li><p>Regularly Sweep the Walls and Floors: Sweep the walls and floors every week or two to remove any built-up dirt and bacteria. This will help reduce the risk of disease transmission and make your apartment more appealing for guests.</p></li><li><p>Use proper Furniture Care: Keep all furniture properly cared for by never leaving it unused for more than 4 hours at a time without cleaning it first. TheMariaDB Forums has a great guide on how to care for a couch or chair.</p></li><li></li></ol><h2 id=residence-at-newark-apartments-1476-residence-drive-newark-oh---rentcafé>Residence At Newark Apartments, 1476 Residence Drive, Newark, OH - RENTCafé<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#residence-at-newark-apartments-1476-residence-drive-newark-oh---rentcafé>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://cdngeneral.rentcafe.com/dmslivecafe/2/92767/1.jpeg?width=350" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.8JeTzDYwSY1yixlh-PyrIAAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Residence At Newark Apartments, 1476 Residence Drive, Newark, OH - RENTCafé"><p><em>Source: rentcafe.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>What are the different types of landlords?

This can include checking in on residents, cleaning up after meals, and maintaining utilities. The biggest benefit to TIP landlords is that they typically have a much longer lease term than other types of landlord, making sure that tenants stay with them for as long as possible.</p></li><li><p>roommates only: These landlords allow tenants to live together but do notrent out the entire unit.instead, each tenant rents out a specific portion of their room or suite.</p></li></ol><h2 id=newark-de-homes-amp-apartments-for-rent>Newark, DE Homes & Apartments For Rent<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#newark-de-homes-amp-apartments-for-rent>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://m.cbhomes.com/p/974/DENC520078/46317Fb56EF04B0/m23cc.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.X7s8YAAl6dkKjkNC7410qQHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Newark, DE Homes & Apartments For Rent"><p><em>Source: coldwellbankerhomes.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Conclusion:
