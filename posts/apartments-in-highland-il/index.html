Regularly checking for new leaks, fixing broken parts, and replacing filters can all help keep your unit habitable.</p></li><li><p>Cleaning and painting: Keeping your building spick and span means cleaning every nook and cranny – from the landing boards to the toilet seats – every week or so.</p></li></ol><h2 id=willow-bend-apartments---rolling-meadows-il--apartmentscom>Willow Bend Apartments - Rolling Meadows, IL | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#willow-bend-apartments---rolling-meadows-il--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images1.apartments.com/i2/-JpNeitR56mzYPiNrT2Y0fJyx6DCBoot91lzv5k0h0k/111/willow-bend-apartments-rolling-meadows-il-outdoor-pool-with-large-sundeck.jpg?p=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.mYmMFdUpLTbBopctRVLskAHaEU&pid=15.1"' alt="Willow Bend Apartments - Rolling Meadows, IL | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a common sight in many cities.
