Rental rates are always changing, but the most popular types of apartments continue to be units that rent for a set amount of time, regardless of how often they may be rented. The terms &ldquo;rent&rdquo; and &ldquo;lease&rdquo; are often used interchangeably when talking about rental rates, but there are important distinctions to make.
