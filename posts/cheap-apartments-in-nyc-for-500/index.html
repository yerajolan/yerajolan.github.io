Apartments are a type of housing that provides residents with living space within a building, as opposed to a single-family home. Apartments can come in different sizes and configurations, depending on the needs of the individual. There are three main types of leases available for apartments: studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom. Each type has its own set of benefits and drawbacks.
