This is because an apartment is larger and more expensive than a rental unit that is not an apartment.</p></li><li><p>Increased security: With apartments, tenants have more potential peace of mind knowing that the building has a locksmith and 24-hour security. This increased security can make it difficult for anyone to break into an apartment.</p></li><li><p>More affordable living space: If an apartment is large enough, it may be cheaper to live in one than in multiple rental units. This is because each individual tenant pays only a portion of the monthly rent, which means that landlords are free to charge whatever they want for their units.</p></li></ol><h2 id=mariner039s-watch-apartments---norfolk-va--apartment-finder>Mariner's Watch Apartments - Norfolk, VA | Apartment Finder<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#mariner039s-watch-apartments---norfolk-va--apartment-finder>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://image4.apartmentfinder.com/i2/uZF2J4g7o8O1HSAU_gEoxuTXGs_405YiqIrsum_UtKU/110/mariners-watch-apartments-norfolk-va-building.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.LMW6t_VP6F7KFJRaW8QBkQHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Mariner's Watch Apartments - Norfolk, VA | Apartment Finder"><p><em>Source: apartmentfinder.com</em></p><blockquote><p>apartments norfolk va mariners mariner stonebridge manor way virginia apartment rent senior adult forrent building rentals.</p></blockquote><p>Suburbs and areas to live in
