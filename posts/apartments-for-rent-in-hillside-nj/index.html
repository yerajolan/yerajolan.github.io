It can be difficult to decide where to move to when you are considering an apartment. You may be considering moving into an apartment near your job, on the edge of a city, or in a rural area. Here are some tips for planning your move.</p><ol><li>Check the monthly rent prices and make sure you can afford it.</li><li>Consider where you will live for the most part of the year. An apartment near work might be good for now, but if you plan to live there permanently, it is important to find out what kind of properties and services are available in that area.</li><li>Get a security deposit so you know you have a place to stay for at least one month if things go wrong with your new place.</li><li>Compare Apartments by Neighborhoods .</li></ol><h2 id=hillside-garden-apartments---keasbey-nj--apartment-finder-1>Hillside Garden Apartments - Keasbey, NJ | Apartment Finder<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hillside-garden-apartments---keasbey-nj--apartment-finder-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="http://image4.apartmentfinder.com/Attachment/New-Jersey/Keasbey-Apartments/Hillside-Garden-Apartments/?x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onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.lWUtWdyd7EJQ3avueIkJ0gAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Hillside Garden Apartments - Keasbey, NJ | Apartment Finder"><p><em>Source: apartmentfinder.com</em></p><blockquote><p>apartments hillside garden nj keasbey apartment.</p></blockquote><p>Benefits of living in an apartment:
