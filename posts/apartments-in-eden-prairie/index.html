Apartments have become a popular choice for people looking for a place to live. They come in many different shapes and sizes, and can be rented either on a month-to-month or year-to-year basis. They&rsquo;re perfect for people who want to be close to everything, but don&rsquo;t want to live in a big city. And, of course, there are always apartment buildings with luxurious bedrooms and bathrooms that you can use as your home office or bedroom suite.</p><h2 id=apple-villa-apartments-ii---apple-valley-mn-55124>Apple Villa Apartments II - Apple Valley, MN 55124<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apple-villa-apartments-ii---apple-valley-mn-55124>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://rentpath-res.cloudinary.com/w_558,h_386,t_rp,cs_tinysrgb,fl_force_strip,c_fill/e_unsharp_mask:50,q_auto/8e0c7a7b4bf84380f05498b00a9b3ab9 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.kbqofdQ69mBEx_uAFOujGwHaFH&pid=15.1"' alt="Apple Villa Apartments II - Apple Valley, MN 55124"><p><em>Source: apartmentguide.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Average rent for an apartment: what it is and how much it costs per month
