A clean apartment is key to a comfortable and healthy lifestyle. However, many people do not take the time to keep their apartments clean. This can lead to a number of problems, such as decreased security and hygiene, increased hazard potential, and an overall less pleasant living environment. Maintenance is key in keeping an apartment clean. Here are three tips to help:</p><ol><li><p>Regularly Sweep the Walls and Floors: Sweep the walls and floors every week or two to remove any built-up dirt and bacteria. This will help reduce the risk of disease transmission and make your apartment more appealing for guests.</p></li><li><p>Use proper Furniture Care: Keep all furniture properly cared for by never leaving it unused for more than 4 hours at a time without cleaning it first. TheMariaDB Forums has a great guide on how to care for a couch or chair.</p></li><li></li></ol><h2 id=heading><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#heading>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hp-spring-5.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.fXSXyjRlr5jTrM8LdxvxWQHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt><p><em>Source: venturebeat.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Rental rates:
Rental rates for apartments have been on the rise in recent years, and there is no doubt that this is a trend that will continue. Many people are looking for an apartment because they feel that it is a more affordable option than renting from a landlord. With so many choices available, it can be hard to know which one is the best for you. Here are three general tips to help you make the best decision:</p><ol><li><p>Get a good deal: When looking at rental rates, always make sure to compare them against similar properties in your area. This will help you figure out what is the best deal for you.</p></li><li><p>Be sure to ask about amenities: Another key factor to consider when looking at apartments is whether or not they offer any features that are specific to your needs.
