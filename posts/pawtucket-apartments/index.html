This can include checking in on residents, cleaning up after meals, and maintaining utilities. The biggest benefit to TIP landlords is that they typically have a much longer lease term than other types of landlord, making sure that tenants stay with them for as long as possible.</p></li><li><p>roommates only: These landlords allow tenants to live together but do notrent out the entire unit.instead, each tenant rents out a specific portion of their room or suite.</p></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://yerajolan.github.io/posts/oneonta-apartments/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Oneonta Apartments ~ Hanceville Village Primary Apartments Al</span></a>
