A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=apartment-in-claymont-de--photos-and-tour--hillside-pointe-1>Apartment In Claymont DE | Photos And Tour | Hillside Pointe<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apartment-in-claymont-de--photos-and-tour--hillside-pointe-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://commoncdn.entrata.com/images/thumbNailer.php?src=/media_library/14181/5c818afe74f1e1.14230594531_thumb.jpg&w=640&h=480" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ylEav_jZRSLCClJBUGKe5QHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Apartment in Claymont DE | Photos and Tour | Hillside Pointe"><p><em>Source: livehillsidepointe.com</em></p><blockquote><p>claymont.</p></blockquote><p>Location: When is an apartment good?
