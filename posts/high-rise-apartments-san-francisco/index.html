When signing a lease, it can be helpful to take into consideration closing costs. Closing costs can amount to a large portion of an apartment&rsquo;s monthly rent, so it&rsquo;s important to have a clear understanding of what they are and how they&rsquo;ll affect your budget. Some common closing costs include moving out of the property, repairs and renovations, and attorney fees.</p><h2 id=buzzard-point-approved-for-all-affordable-76-unit-apartment-building>Buzzard Point Approved For All-affordable, 76-unit Apartment Building<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#buzzard-point-approved-for-all-affordable-76-unit-apartment-building>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/akOny8c67rN1SEYOy5T1k_viDis=/0x0:1261x779/1200x800/filters:focal(531x290:731x490)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57425115/Screen_Shot_2017_06_22_at_12.03.07_PM.0.0.png" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.-ymgwMO6w9X663FFq2mWYgHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Buzzard Point approved for all-affordable, 76-unit apartment building"><p><em>Source: dc.curbed.com</em></p><blockquote><p>building apartment unit residential buzzard point commercial renderings via approved affordable pgn associates tm architects.</p></blockquote><p>The history of apartment living
