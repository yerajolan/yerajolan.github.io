Apartments have been a part of humanity for centuries, and some of the earliest examples date back to the ancient Greeks. In Rome, apartments were originally used as quarters for the rich and powerful, and in many cases remain an important part of today’s social lives.

The first thing that sets apartments apart from traditional homes is their size. A typical apartment typically occupies several hundred square feet - which is larger than most households in a town or city. This increase in space allows apartments to accommodate more people, making them more convenient and affordable than traditional homes.</p><p>Another unique characteristic of apartments is their location.</p><h2 id=belltown-townhouses-under-600---seattle-wa---1060-townhouses>Belltown Townhouses Under $600 - Seattle, WA - 1,060 Townhouses<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#belltown-townhouses-under-600---seattle-wa---1060-townhouses>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/GA7KeOTnIc_lHdXO9yi_sPLZtVYxDQ-sFJcGkArRxII/102/belltown-seattle-wa-neighborhood-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIF.w4x8Nz0tbUFn6hQ8WpMH%2fQ&pid=15.1"' alt="Belltown Townhouses under $600 - Seattle, WA - 1,060 Townhouses"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Location of apartments: near the city or far from it?
