A recent study by real estate company Zillow has revealed that the average apartment size in the U.S. is small, medium, and large. The largest apartment sizes were found in California, with an average size of 4,200 square feet. In addition, the average apartment size in Texas was 2,500 square feet. The findings of the study are significant because they may help to change how people think about apartments and their potentialities as a space to live.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://yerajolan.github.io/posts/jersey-city-waterfront-apartments/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Jersey City Waterfront Apartments : Edison Lofts Orange West Converted Former Apartments Thomas Factory Being Into Minno Wasko Architects Credit</span></a>
