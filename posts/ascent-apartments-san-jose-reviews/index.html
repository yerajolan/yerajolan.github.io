One way to determine whether an apartment is good or not is to look at the standards set by the apartment building or association. If the building or association has high standards, then the apartments will likely be of good quality. However, if the standards are lower, then the apartments may not be as good as they should be. It is important to check these standards before choosing an apartment, so that you can be sure that you are getting what you expect.</p><h2 id=ascent---210-reviews--san-jose-ca-apartments-for-rent--apartmentratings>Ascent - 210 Reviews | San Jose, CA Apartments For Rent | ApartmentRatings©<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ascent---210-reviews--san-jose-ca-apartments-for-rent--apartmentratings>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://cimg4.ibsrv.net/ibimg/www.apartmentratings.com/650x433_85-1/1/1/6/11670106118976582841001214.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.O6kVJF4BvlgyryjE-vdz9AHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="Ascent - 210 Reviews | San Jose, CA Apartments for Rent | ApartmentRatings©"><p><em>Source: apartmentratings.com</em></p><blockquote><p>ascent.</p></blockquote><p>What are Apartments?
