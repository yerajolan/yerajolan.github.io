If you&rsquo;re looking for a place to call your own, an apartment may be the answer. In fact, according to a report from apartment research site RENTCafé, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in America is $2,451 per month – which works out to be just over $30 per day. And while it may seem like an expensive proposition, there are plenty of ways to save on rent without moving out of your comfort zone.
For one, consider sleeping in your own bed instead of sharing a bedroom with someone else. Not only does this make living alone more affordable, but it also allows you to get more done in a shorter amount of time – meaning you can spend more time with loved ones.</p><h2 id=spring-valley-apartments---apartment>Spring Valley Apartments - Apartment<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#spring-valley-apartments---apartment>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://springvalleydcapts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spring_valley_06-1200x0.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.gR5NbRSB5DMRwqgA32OIpgHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Spring Valley Apartments - Apartment"><p><em>Source: springvalleydcapts.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Amenities: different amenities depending on the apartment.
