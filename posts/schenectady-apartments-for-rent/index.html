A few notable examples from throughout history include the Star-Kist Building in New York City, which was built in 1907 as a luxury hotel. Additionally, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in London was one of the first buildings to be occupied by tenants with apartments on top.</p><p>In recent years, apartment buildings have become even more popular, with many people looking for an affordable lifestyle closer to their work or home.</p><h2 id=park-place-at-wilton-apartments---gansevoort-ny--apartmentscom>Park Place At Wilton Apartments - Gansevoort, NY | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#park-place-at-wilton-apartments---gansevoort-ny--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/y_ZteAiaJKm1gFXJhs1pwQ69w2WX8ujEJU-ct4JyezY/111/park-place-at-wilton-gansevoort-ny-primary-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP._o56FGlUthWJbC2-v5LtgQHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Park Place at Wilton Apartments - Gansevoort, NY | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>place park wilton apartments ny gansevoort.</p></blockquote><p>Loft apartments:

Apartments have been a part of humanity for centuries, and some of the earliest examples date back to the ancient Greeks. In Rome, apartments were originally used as quarters for the rich and powerful, and in many cases remain an important part of today’s social lives. In modern times, apartment buildings have become a popular choice for individuals who want to live close to friends and family, but there are a few things that make them unique from other types of dwelling.
The first thing that sets apartments apart from traditional homes is their size. A typical apartment typically occupies several hundred square feet - which is larger than most households in a town or city. This increase in space allows apartments to accommodate more people, making them more convenient and affordable than traditional homes.</p><p>Another unique characteristic of apartments is their location.</p><h2 id=apartments-for-rent-in-schenectady-ny--zillow>Apartments For Rent In Schenectady NY | Zillow<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apartments-for-rent-in-schenectady-ny--zillow>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_e/IS23fcy9ktlq190000000000.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.m2juMdNVUHRJoOiSurmuAgHaFi&pid=15.1"' alt="Apartments For Rent in Schenectady NY | Zillow"><p><em>Source: zillow.com</em></p><blockquote><p>schenectady.</p></blockquote><p>What is an apartment and how does it differ from a home?
