Heat-returning air conditioning systems (HRSAs) are commonly used in apartments to keep the living areas and corridors cool during the summer months. They can be very effective at cooling down large areas, but they can also be a nuisance if left on for too long. To avoid waking up your roommate in the middle of the night, it is important to set up your HRSA wisely.</p><h2 id=legacy-cottages-of-south-jordan-apartments---south-jordan-ut>Legacy Cottages Of South Jordan Apartments - South Jordan, UT<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#legacy-cottages-of-south-jordan-apartments---south-jordan-ut>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images1.apartments.com/i2/H3mw4-7L_ChiW_wZVed1cG8CCe4vfh-33tOMGnWdNWs/117/legacy-cottages-of-south-jordan-south-jordan-ut-building-photo.jpg?p=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Qq3GlKm78uvor_YY-4h-lgHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Legacy Cottages of South Jordan Apartments - South Jordan, UT"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>legacy cottages jordan south ut apartments.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a type of housing that is often found in larger cities.
