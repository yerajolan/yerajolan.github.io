-If an apartment is not fit for habitation, the landlord can sell it to another tenant or demolish it.
-Apartments are usually divided into two categories: &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; and &ldquo;floating.&rdquo; Fixed apartments are typically rented out month-to-month, while floating apartments allow for monthly rent but may also be available for lease or purchase.
Tenants who live in fixed apartments should be aware that they can&rsquo;t move out unless they get a new lease or break their current lease.</p><h2 id=expo-apartments---minneapolis-mn--apartmentscom>EXPO Apartments - Minneapolis, MN | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#expo-apartments---minneapolis-mn--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/YHLLcPjDcwgwjUM_cHsCBfWdDmY1z0B0wRGwVSz90Os/111/expo-minneapolis-mn-primary-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.tF6yCUSEYI1-7wwA5PP6EQHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="EXPO Apartments - Minneapolis, MN | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments may be associated with a certain level of luxury, but they can also be affordable and provide a place to live that’s close to what you need.

When it comes to apartments, it really depends on what you&rsquo;re looking for. If you&rsquo;re only looking for a place to stay for a few months or if you&rsquo;re only looking for a place to live permanently, then the cost of an apartment shouldn&rsquo;t really matter too much.
