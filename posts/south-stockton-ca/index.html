Rental prices can vary greatly with time, depending on the market. For example, a one-bedroom apartment might cost $800 per month in the morning, but may be worth $1,200 at night when there are more people in the building. This annualized inflation rate is typically around 2%.

However, which apartment is right for you can be difficult to determine. Here are six tips to help make the decision:</p><ol><li><p>Measure your needs: When measuring your needs, it&rsquo;s important to take into account what kind of living space you&rsquo;ll be using and how much space you&rsquo;ll have within your budget. A one-bedroom apartment might not be enough for someone who wants a lot of extra storage space, while a two-bedroom might fit more people comfortably.</p></li><li><p>Compare prices: It&rsquo;s also important to compare prices before signing a lease. Different areas have different rent rates and may require a higher or lower down payment than others.</p></li></ol><h2 id=366-homes-for-sale-in-stockton-ca---stockton-real-estate-ca>366+ Homes For Sale In Stockton, CA - Stockton Real Estate, CA<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#366-homes-for-sale-in-stockton-ca---stockton-real-estate-ca>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://cdn.houzquest.com/processed/614796e27869b468eb793e32/jpeg/614798016ef60a1b565284cd_768_576.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.iMWjESp_wUCVOZfWokVtVgHaFi&pid=15.1"' alt="366+ Homes for Sale in Stockton, CA - Stockton Real Estate, CA"><p><em>Source: houzquest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>stockton.</p></blockquote><p>Living spaces: Open or closed air concept.
