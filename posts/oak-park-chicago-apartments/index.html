Apartments provide a variety of benefits to tenants. These benefits can include:</p><ol><li><p>Reduced rent costs: A landlord can reduce their monthly rent by providing an apartment. This is because an apartment is larger and more expensive than a rental unit that is not an apartment.</p></li><li><p>Increased security: With apartments, tenants have more potential peace of mind knowing that the building has a locksmith and 24-hour security. This increased security can make it difficult for anyone to break into an apartment.</p></li><li><p>More affordable living space: If an apartment is large enough, it may be cheaper to live in one than in multiple rental units. This is because each individual tenant pays only a portion of the monthly rent, which means that landlords are free to charge whatever they want for their units.</p></li></ol><h2 id=219-chicago-ave-1-oak-park-il---1-bed-1-bath-condo---19-photos--trulia>219 Chicago Ave #1, Oak Park, IL - 1 Bed, 1 Bath Condo - 19 Photos | Trulia<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#219-chicago-ave-1-oak-park-il---1-bed-1-bath-condo---19-photos--trulia>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.trulia.com/pictures/thumbs_6/zillowstatic/fp/ad1c1bf17205752e263ca9401e60ebcc-full.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.0Wam-lIbNVquOuXwzdJu4wHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="219 Chicago Ave #1, Oak Park, IL - 1 Bed, 1 Bath Condo - 19 Photos | Trulia"><p><em>Source: trulia.com</em></p><blockquote><p>trulia.</p></blockquote><p>Types of apartments:

A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years.
