Tenants and landlords are two of the most important people in a landlord’s life. They help to make sure that the rent is paid, that the property is clean, and that all of the necessary paperwork is done to get a lease. They also help to manage the complex relationships between tenant and landlord.</p><h2 id=westpark-apartments--campus-properties-4-lease>WESTPARK APARTMENTS | Campus Properties 4 Lease<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#westpark-apartments--campus-properties-4-lease>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://lirp.cdn-website.com/7a36102a/dms3rep/multi/opt/One+Bed-11-1920w.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Lfi4NUjAMFtYXplKU2q1eQHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="WESTPARK APARTMENTS | Campus Properties 4 Lease"><p><em>Source: campusproperties4lease.com</em></p><blockquote><p>westpark.</p></blockquote><p>Security:
Thanks to security cameras and other security measures, apartments are among the most secure places in town. However, there are still a few common flaws that can lead to loss of life or property. Here are three tips for keeping your apartment safe:</p><ol><li>Keep your door locked when you leave and when you come back in. This will help protect yourself and your belongings from thieves.</li><li>Make sure your apartment is well-lit at all times. This will make it easier for anyone who may be looking for you while you&rsquo;re away.</li><li>Keep your windows closed and never leave your door open if you have a dog or cat. This will help keep them safe from getting into trouble while you&rsquo;re away.</li></ol><h2 id=100-park-apartments---college-station-tx-77840>100 Park Apartments - College Station, TX 77840<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#100-park-apartments---college-station-tx-77840>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://rentpath-res.cloudinary.com/w_370,h_370,t_rp,cs_tinysrgb,fl_force_strip,c_fill/e_unsharp_mask:50,q_auto/ccc3eb7d36dfb8262a5138598c22d891 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.fZtUFBmyMXhSTHzAxXOjTwAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="100 Park Apartments - College Station, TX 77840"><p><em>Source: apartmentguide.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Types of apartments:
