A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=grand-estates--keller-apartment-rentals---keller-tx--zillow>Grand Estates @ Keller Apartment Rentals - Keller, TX | Zillow<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#grand-estates--keller-apartment-rentals---keller-tx--zillow>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a3f16b260f906ed9c1783ba805136f44-cc_ft_768.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Sze6cmQsEMP_Yxv0z309fwHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Grand Estates @ Keller Apartment Rentals - Keller, TX | Zillow"><p><em>Source: zillow.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Tenants and landlords:

When it comes to apartments, there are a few main options on the market. Some people might prefer urban living, while others may prefer suburban living. There are a variety of apartment types available, depending on what someone is looking for. For example, a studio apartment could be used for someone who only needs one room and is not interested in having a full sized home. Alternatively, an apartment with a courtyard could be perfect for someone who wants to live near nature but doesn&rsquo;t want to live in an urban area. All of these apartments have their own pros and cons, so it&rsquo;s important to decide what type of apartment is right for you.</p><h2 id=jackson-san-antonio---825-for-1-2-amp-3-bed-apts>Jackson San Antonio - $825+ For 1, 2 & 3 Bed Apts<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#jackson-san-antonio---825-for-1-2-amp-3-bed-apts>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://picturescdn.alndata.com/?pid=3d32fa6f-5b28-4360-8b73-41b80d5a9835&h=528" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.N9_v7QTememMbho2dMoeVgHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Jackson San Antonio - $825+ for 1, 2 & 3 Bed Apts"><p><em>Source: umovefree.com</em></p><blockquote><p>keller forrent.</p></blockquote><p>What are apartments?
