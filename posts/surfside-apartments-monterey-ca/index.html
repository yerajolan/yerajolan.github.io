Here are four keytypes of apartment landlords:</p><ol><li><p>Tenant-in-possession (TIP): These landlords take on the responsibility of managing the property on behalf of their tenants. This can include checking in on residents, cleaning up after meals, and maintaining utilities. The biggest benefit to TIP landlords is that they typically have a much longer lease term than other types of landlord, making sure that tenants stay with them for as long as possible.</p></li><li><p>roommates only: These landlords allow tenants to live together but do notrent out the entire unit.instead, each tenant rents out a specific portion of their room or suite.</p></li></ol><h2 id=carmel-by-the-sea-ca-apartments-for-rent---137-apartments--rentcom>Carmel By The Sea, CA Apartments For Rent - 137 Apartments | Rent.com®<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#carmel-by-the-sea-ca-apartments-for-rent---137-apartments--rentcom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://rentpath-res.cloudinary.com/t_rp,cs_tinysrgb,fl_force_strip,w_400,h_240,c_fill,q_auto:low,dpr_1.0,e_improve/e_unsharp_mask:50/19ba54089d6fc0de28e7603e31a90979 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.WdCtZxuD38B1PKv6Y0Q4ZAAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Carmel By The Sea, CA Apartments for Rent - 137 Apartments | Rent.com®"><p><em>Source: rent.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>What would you like to know about apartment life in a city?

Are Pets Allowed In Apartments?
There is no definitive answer to this question since it depends on the apartment complex and the rules of that particular complex. Generally speaking, pets are not allowed in apartments, but there is a wide range of exceptions depending on the apartment complex. Some complexes may allow pets while others may not. It is always best to check with the management of an apartment complex before making a decision about whether or not your pet can live in your unit.</p><h2 id=151-surf-way-monterey-ca-93940---realtorcom-1>151 Surf Way, Monterey, CA 93940 - Realtor.com®<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#151-surf-way-monterey-ca-93940---realtorcom-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://ar.rdcpix.com/1323732403/4a62142a6381349700e05faf4fb6eeabc-f24xd-w1020_h770_q80.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.yHPRO6z1ma_BM9w7AcMhbwHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="151 Surf Way, Monterey, CA 93940 - realtor.com®"><p><em>Source: realtor.com</em></p><blockquote><p>monterey.</p></blockquote><p>Tips for Planning your Apartment Move
