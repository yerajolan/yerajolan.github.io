Rental rates are always changing, but the most popular types of apartments continue to be units that rent for a set amount of time, regardless of how often they may be rented. The terms &ldquo;rent&rdquo; and &ldquo;lease&rdquo; are often used interchangeably when talking about rental rates, but there are important distinctions to make. Renting an apartment generally means that you will be living in it for an entire period of time- usually between one and six months. Leases on the other hand, can be for a shorter or longer period- typically one to three years.
Most apartments these days come with some type of agreement in place in order to ensure that you will be living in them for at least the minimum length of time required by the lease.</p><h2 id=hillcrest-senior-apartments---apartments-for-rent--redfin>Hillcrest Senior Apartments - Apartments For Rent | Redfin<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hillcrest-senior-apartments---apartments-for-rent--redfin>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://ssl.cdn-redfin.com/photo/rent/ecfcc5ec-285f-4c13-a4b2-1b85519c46e0/mbpaddedwide/genMid.18_1.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIF.mrzaaJPoZH2UWtdgoooVEQ&pid=15.1"' alt="Hillcrest Senior Apartments - Apartments for Rent | Redfin"><p><em>Source: redfin.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments can be a great way to live if you&rsquo;re looking for a small, affordable space.

If you&rsquo;re looking for a place to call your own, an apartment may be the answer. In fact, according to a report from apartment research site RENTCafé, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in America is $2,451 per month – which works out to be just over $30 per day. And while it may seem like an expensive proposition, there are plenty of ways to save on rent without moving out of your comfort zone.

By the1920s, New York City and London had started to build large, high-rise apartments that became known as &ldquo;skyscrapers.&rdquo;
