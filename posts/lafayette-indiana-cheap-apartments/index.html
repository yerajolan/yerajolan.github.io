A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=apartments-in-lafayette-indiana-that-accept-section-8---alenaschaad-1>Apartments In Lafayette Indiana That Accept Section 8 - Alenaschaad<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apartments-in-lafayette-indiana-that-accept-section-8---alenaschaad-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/jsP_Yuqh3n9plZXoIFU4dMomSd83beNDVeRYXMXj5hA/117/chauncey-village-apartments-lafayette-in-building-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jMpUYt-lDjeAAoMnWsC_VAHaEa&pid=15.1"' alt="Apartments In Lafayette Indiana That Accept Section 8 - alenaschaad"><p><em>Source: alenaschaad.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>lafayette chauncey indiana.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments have been around for centuries and are considered a vital part of the cityscape.
