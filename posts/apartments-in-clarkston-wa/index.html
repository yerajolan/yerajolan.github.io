Best apartments for the budget don&rsquo;t have to be complex or luxurious. There are plenty of apartments that can fit your needs, without breaking the bank. Here are a few tips to help you find the perfect apartment for you:</p><ol><li><p>Look at what kind of living space is available in your area. Ideally, an apartment should have at least three bedrooms and two bathrooms.

Apartments are one of the most common places to live in the United States. With an average of 2,000 apartments per capita, they offer a great place to live and raise a family. However, apartment complexes can be a risky place to live. There are a variety of factors that can make apartment complexes less safe for residents, and some have even gone so far as to call them “shady” or “unsafe.”
One of the most important things that residents should do when living in an apartment complex is to be aware of their surroundings. This way, they can avoid being alone in unfamiliar areas and/or being approached by someone who may want to harm them. Additionally, it is important to beaware of any hidden dangers that may exist inside an apartment complex.</p><h2 id=the-highland-apartments---1222-highland-ave-clarkston-wa>The Highland Apartments - 1222 Highland Ave. Clarkston, WA<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-highland-apartments---1222-highland-ave-clarkston-wa>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://clarkstonapartments.com/highland/images/living.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.WFZ6gjNNGvYqrt1bzCok4AAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="The Highland Apartments - 1222 Highland Ave. Clarkston, WA"><p><em>Source: clarkstonapartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>clarkston.</p></blockquote><p>How to choose the right apartment:
