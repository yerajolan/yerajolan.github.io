Apartment living has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many people looking for a place to call home. However, there are a variety of different types of apartments available, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here are four key distinctions between apartments and other types of housing:</p><ol><li><p>Rentals: In most cases, apartments are rented to individuals rather than being bought outright. This means that the landlord usually pays the tenant directly – either monthly or annually – rather than providing finance or assistance in finding a lender. As a result, rentals tend to be cheaper per month than buying an apartment outright.</p></li><li><p>Size: Apartments vary in size from small to large. Most typically comprise two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms, while some can contain up to six bedrooms and bathrooms.</p></li></ol><h2 id=the-morton---grand-rapids-mi--apartment-finder>The Morton - Grand Rapids, MI | Apartment Finder<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-morton---grand-rapids-mi--apartment-finder>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://image4.apartmentfinder.com/i2/R0lfReYMqvlQO90hBFd2FaGNN9jm5I6wQ0h2v87EtGc/110/the-morton-grand-rapids-mi-primary-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.mY04cmqnLX4F52fXm7iw_gHaGX&pid=15.1"' alt="The Morton - Grand Rapids, MI | Apartment Finder"><p><em>Source: apartmentfinder.com</em></p><blockquote><p>morton rapids grand downtown mi apartments michigan rent apartment.</p></blockquote><p>What is an apartment?
