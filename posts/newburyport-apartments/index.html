In the late 1800s, apartment buildings began to rise in popularity and were built in Prussian cities such as Berlin and Dresden. By the1920s, New York City and London had started to build large, high-rise apartments that became known as “skyscrapers.” Today, apartment buildings are still an important part of the cityscape and are popular among tourists and professionals.
