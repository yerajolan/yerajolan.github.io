The average rent for an apartment in the U.S. is $2,500, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. This is a high price point for apartments, especially when compared to other types of housing. The increase in rent prices has been caused by a number of factors, including population growth and the difficulty in finding affordable space.

Rental rates are always changing, but the most popular types of apartments continue to be units that rent for a set amount of time, regardless of how often they may be rented. The terms &ldquo;rent&rdquo; and &ldquo;lease&rdquo; are often used interchangeably when talking about rental rates, but there are important distinctions to make. Renting an apartment generally means that you will be living in it for an entire period of time- usually between one and six months. Leases on the other hand, can be for a shorter or longer period- typically one to three years.
Most apartments these days come with some type of agreement in place in order to ensure that you will be living in them for at least the minimum length of time required by the lease.</p><h2 id=gardens-at-camp-creek---45-reviews--atlanta-ga-apartments-for-rent-3>Gardens At Camp Creek - 45 Reviews | Atlanta, GA Apartments For Rent<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gardens-at-camp-creek---45-reviews--atlanta-ga-apartments-for-rent-3>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://cimg1.ibsrv.net/ibimg/www.apartmentratings.com/650x350_85-1/7/7/6/776970795106181698577.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.tR1g0XXgIr6B86NI_zZu-gHaD_&pid=15.1"' alt="Gardens at Camp Creek - 45 Reviews | Atlanta, GA Apartments for Rent"><p><em>Source: apartmentratings.com</em></p><blockquote><p>apartmentratings.</p></blockquote><p>When to Rent an apartment: often depends on the location.
