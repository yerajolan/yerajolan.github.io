Apartment living has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many people looking for a place to call home. However, there are a variety of different types of apartments available, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here are four key distinctions between apartments and other types of housing:</p><ol><li><p>Rentals: In most cases, apartments are rented to individuals rather than being bought outright. This means that the landlord usually pays the tenant directly – either monthly or annually – rather than providing finance or assistance in finding a lender. As a result, rentals tend to be cheaper per month than buying an apartment outright.</p></li><li><p>Size: Apartments vary in size from small to large. Most typically comprise two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms, while some can contain up to six bedrooms and bathrooms.</p></li></ol><h2 id=1140-ne-beacon-dr-grants-pass-or-97526--mls-102935595--redfin>1140 NE Beacon Dr, Grants Pass, OR 97526 | MLS# 102935595 | Redfin<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1140-ne-beacon-dr-grants-pass-or-97526--mls-102935595--redfin>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://ssl.cdn-redfin.com/photo/199/bigphoto/595/102935595_0.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.RHWFZMh4FFgGLPDe_c8sNQHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="1140 NE Beacon Dr, Grants Pass, OR 97526 | MLS# 102935595 | Redfin"><p><em>Source: redfin.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>The Pros and Cons of Renting an Apartment
