Here are four examples:</p><ol><li>Houses- These are typically small, two- or three-bedroom apartments that sit on a small plot of land. Most come with a kitchenette and one or two bathrooms.</li><li>Condos- These are large, five or six-bedroom apartments that sit on a large lot. They often come with gardens, private balconies, and robust security systems.</li><li>Townhouses- These are similar to condos but they are smaller and more condensed - often having only two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms.

There are many types of landlords, from apartment landlords to hotel landlords. Each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here are four keytypes of apartment landlords:</p><ol><li><p>Tenant-in-possession (TIP): These landlords take on the responsibility of managing the property on behalf of their tenants. This can include checking in on residents, cleaning up after meals, and maintaining utilities. The biggest benefit to TIP landlords is that they typically have a much longer lease term than other types of landlord, making sure that tenants stay with them for as long as possible.</p></li><li><p>roommates only: These landlords allow tenants to live together but do notrent out the entire unit.instead, each tenant rents out a specific portion of their room or suite.</p></li></ol><h2 id=apartment-in-atlanta-cheap---apartmentsandhousesforrentus>Apartment In Atlanta Cheap - ApartmentsandHousesforRent.us<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apartment-in-atlanta-cheap---apartmentsandhousesforrentus>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://apartmentsandhousesforrent.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/apartments-in-atlanta-city-1024x683.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.MJ7_T7qyoSBLLxpNJg7AXAHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Apartment in Atlanta cheap - ApartmentsandHousesforRent.us"><p><em>Source: apartmentsandhousesforrent.us</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a great way to live in a city.
