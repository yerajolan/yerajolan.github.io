A kitchen is a vital part of any apartment, and should include everything you need for cooking food (pots, pans, utensils, etc.), as well as storage space for your dishes and cookware. Additionally, the kitchen should include a dining area where you can eat meals with friends or family members, as well as a bedroom where you can sleep.</p><h2 id=3-bedroom-apartments-for-rent-in-el-paso-tx---page-4--apartmentscom>3 Bedroom Apartments For Rent In El Paso TX - Page 4 | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-bedroom-apartments-for-rent-in-el-paso-tx---page-4--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/o1PesBk7i_88-kTAE2Bihlh-LMA84xNtbKUqQq3cc3A/117/image.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Gd4eFcx9Y1bxs5-3p33VtAHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="3 Bedroom Apartments for Rent in El Paso TX - Page 4 | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Size and layout: What are some common apartment features?
