According to the RENTCafé study, the average monthly rent for an apartment is $2,878. That may not seem like a lot, but it’s equivalent to the rent for a one-bedroom in most cities. However, there are a variety of factors that could affect an individual’s monthly budget and rent payment. For example, location could be a determining factor when looking to buy an apartment. Additionally, some apartments offer larger discounts if they are rented months in advance.</p><h2 id=low-income-rental-housing-near-me---home>Low Income Rental Housing Near Me - HOME<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#low-income-rental-housing-near-me---home>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://roomsproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/low-income-rental-housing-near-me-630x380.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.hOOFsHn5hZN7eBpdDE_4gwHaEd&pid=15.1"' alt="Low Income Rental Housing Near Me - HOME"><p><em>Source: roomsproject.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Types of Apartments: One-, two-, three-, four-, five-, six-, seven-story buildings?
