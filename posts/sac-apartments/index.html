As the population continues to grow, so does the need for apartments. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a one-bedroom or two- bedrooms, there are plenty of options to choose from. However, which apartment is right for you can be difficult to determine. Here are six tips to help make the decision:</p><ol><li><p>Measure your needs: When measuring your needs, it&rsquo;s important to take into account what kind of living space you&rsquo;ll be using and how much space you&rsquo;ll have within your budget. A one-bedroom apartment might not be enough for someone who wants a lot of extra storage space, while a two-bedroom might fit more people comfortably.</p></li><li><p>Compare prices: It&rsquo;s also important to compare prices before signing a lease.
