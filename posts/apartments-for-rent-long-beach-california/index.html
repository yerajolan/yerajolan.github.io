Apartment living has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many people looking for a place to call home. However, there are a variety of different types of apartments available, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here are four key distinctions between apartments and other types of housing:</p><ol><li><p>Rentals: In most cases, apartments are rented to individuals rather than being bought outright. This means that the landlord usually pays the tenant directly – either monthly or annually – rather than providing finance or assistance in finding a lender. As a result, rentals tend to be cheaper per month than buying an apartment outright.</p></li><li><p>Size: Apartments vary in size from small to large. Most typically comprise two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms, while some can contain up to six bedrooms and bathrooms.</p></li></ol><h2 id=elm-terrace-senior-apartments---long-beach-ca--apartmentscom>Elm Terrace Senior Apartments - Long Beach, CA | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#elm-terrace-senior-apartments---long-beach-ca--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images1.apartments.com/i2/XnbduzsDoqtfIqoA7GoDVIx5-dLA23D_twqHFo9tmdY/111/elm-terrace-senior-apartments-long-beach-ca-building-photo.jpg?p=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.S3rkS1SKZSJPXt6MjC_K2AHaFY&pid=15.1"' alt="Elm Terrace Senior Apartments - Long Beach, CA | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a type of housing that is typically used for people who live in cities.
