A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=farmington-crossing-apartments-for-rent-in-farmington-ut--forrentcom>Farmington Crossing Apartments For Rent In Farmington, UT | ForRent.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#farmington-crossing-apartments-for-rent-in-farmington-ut--forrentcom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.forrent.com/i2/Jf-JoQoidjJfXarseyeXDMfM0RsjcFDXl-EDSk93SI8/117/image.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.JU2Mv38AudqXh_gMvPE3wAHaE9&pid=15.1"' alt="Farmington Crossing Apartments For Rent in Farmington, UT | ForRent.com"><p><em>Source: forrent.com</em></p><blockquote><p>farmington crossing forrent.</p></blockquote><p>Size and layout of apartments: Loft, standard, condo, 2-3bedroom, 4-5bedroom.
