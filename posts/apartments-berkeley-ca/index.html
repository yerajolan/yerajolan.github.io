As apartment landlords, you know that being secure and privacy-conscious is important in any building. But what about when someone is inside your building?
There are a few things that you can do to make sure your guests are safe and comfortable while they&rsquo;re in your building. One is to make sure all doors and windows are locked when they&rsquo;re not allowed in. Another is to install security cameras in your building, so you can see who&rsquo;s coming or going and make sure they&rsquo;re not causing damage.</p><p>Finally, be careful about who you let into your building. Make sure you have a list of people who have been approved by the police or other security forces before letting them into the building. This way, you can be sure that everyone who&rsquo;s entering is properly licensed and has proper identification.</p><h2 id=apartment-rentals-in-berkeley-ca--1122u-apartments--photo-gallery>Apartment Rentals In Berkeley, CA | 1122U Apartments | Photo Gallery<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apartment-rentals-in-berkeley-ca--1122u-apartments--photo-gallery>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://cdngeneral.rentcafe.com/dmslivecafe/3/580736/090518_1122U_Web1358.jpg?crop=(0,0,300,200)&cropxunits=300&cropyunits=200&quality=85&quality=10&width=746&height=560&mode=crop&quality=10" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.3HFJ3_n49MFc2vrjixcd8QHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Apartment Rentals in Berkeley, CA | 1122U Apartments | Photo Gallery"><p><em>Source: live1122u.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Pets

However, there are a few things to consider before getting a pet. Here are three tips:</p><ol><li><p>Check with your apartment complex if they allow pets.
