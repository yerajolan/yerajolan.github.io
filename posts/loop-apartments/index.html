Apartments can be classified into various types based on their features and settings. Some of the most common types of apartments include one, two, three, four, five, and six bedroom units. There are also studio apartments and townhouses to be found in cities and large metropolitan areas.
One of the most important factors when choosing an apartment is its location. Units that are close to transportation or other amenities are often more affordable than ones located further away from all these things. Another important factor to consider is what type of apartment the tenant will be using. Studios and one-bedrooms tend to be smaller than two- or three-bedroom units, so it may be a better decision not to have those in your search if you plan on living alone.</p><h2 id=luxury-apartments-in-chicago--downtown-apartment-company>Luxury Apartments In Chicago | Downtown Apartment Company<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#luxury-apartments-in-chicago--downtown-apartment-company>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://www.downtownapartmentcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Luxury-Apartments-for-Rent.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Hm8r7hont7FBRyEE-Q6m-gHaF_&pid=15.1"' alt="Luxury Apartments in Chicago | Downtown Apartment Company"><p><em>Source: downtownapartmentcompany.com</em></p><blockquote><p>apartments luxury rent chicago apartment loop downtown condo interior rental bedroom downtownapartmentcompany streeterville rentals kitchen.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a type of housing that is typically found in metropolitan areas.

A few notable examples from throughout history include the Star-Kist Building in New York City, which was built in 1907 as a luxury hotel.
