Are Pets Allowed In Apartments?
There is no definitive answer to this question since it depends on the apartment complex and the rules of that particular complex. Generally speaking, pets are not allowed in apartments, but there is a wide range of exceptions depending on the apartment complex. Some complexes may allow pets while others may not. It is always best to check with the management of an apartment complex before making a decision about whether or not your pet can live in your unit.</p><h2 id=43-homes--columbus-ohio-realtors--central-ohio-real-estate>43 Homes | Columbus Ohio Realtors | Central Ohio Real Estate<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#43-homes--columbus-ohio-realtors--central-ohio-real-estate>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.43homes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/gahanna-ohio-homes-for-sale-360x360.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.zo0OXtbMRnJ8GQWHXhdbYAAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="43 Homes | Columbus Ohio Realtors | Central Ohio Real Estate"><p><em>Source: 43homes.com</em></p><blockquote><p>ohio.</p></blockquote><p>Benefits of apartments:

Apartments provide a variety of benefits to tenants. These benefits can include:</p><ol><li><p>Reduced rent costs: A landlord can reduce their monthly rent by providing an apartment. This is because an apartment is larger and more expensive than a rental unit that is not an apartment.</p></li><li><p>Increased security: With apartments, tenants have more potential peace of mind knowing that the building has a locksmith and 24-hour security. This increased security can make it difficult for anyone to break into an apartment.</p></li><li><p>More affordable living space: If an apartment is large enough, it may be cheaper to live in one than in multiple rental units. This is because each individual tenant pays only a portion of the monthly rent, which means that landlords are free to charge whatever they want for their units.</p></li></ol><h2 id=horizons-apartments---hilliard-oh--apartmentscom>Horizons Apartments - Hilliard, OH | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#horizons-apartments---hilliard-oh--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/PMU06e2YuHXqm0SorHb4MMD3ByNLJx0MXpmUOSJ5JWU/111/horizons-apartments-hilliard-oh-primary-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.-dOamh3rMiU7nf1iJacWgQHaEu&pid=15.1"' alt="Horizons Apartments - Hilliard, OH | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>hilliard.</p></blockquote><p>Location of apartments:
