When it comes to apartments, there are two types of people: those who want the convenience and those who want the features. Some people prefer to live in an apartment because they can walk to their jobs or nearby stores, while others might prefer living in a complex with multiple units so they can easily get around. It all comes down to what someone is looking for.
If you&rsquo;re looking for an apartment that&rsquo;s close to your job but don&rsquo;t mind having some extra noise and traffic, then a complex might be the best option for you. If you&rsquo;re prefer an apartment that offers everything from luxurious amenities like a fitness room and pool to basic necessities like parking and heat, however, a walk-up may be your best bet.
