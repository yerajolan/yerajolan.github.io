One of these is the maintenance and cleaning fees that may be required by the landlord. In addition, other factors such as distance from work or school might also influence these costs. If they are not taken into consideration, renters could end up paying a high amount of money for their unit.</p><h2 id=whispering-oaks-apartments---waukegan-il--apartmentscom>Whispering Oaks Apartments - Waukegan, IL | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#whispering-oaks-apartments---waukegan-il--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/wYEM5mjVVKNhHcCbkz4YiU9JUClZbHxXhtb2xY54_rs/111/whispering-oaks-apartments-waukegan-il-primary-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.0s98RQEjWyqzwaQ6OV45LAHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Whispering Oaks Apartments - Waukegan, IL | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>whispering oaks apartments waukegan apartment chicago north income low rent tours illinois 3d.</p></blockquote><p>Benefits of living in an apartment:
