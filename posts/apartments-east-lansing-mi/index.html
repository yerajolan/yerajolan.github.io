Renting apartments can be a great option for those who are looking to live in a new and exciting city. However, there are some important things to consider when renting an apartment. One of the most important things to keep in mind is the type of rent you can afford. There are three main types of rent: monthly, weekly, and daily. These different terms have different implications on how much you can save each month.
Monthly Rent: Monthly rent is usually the most affordable type of rent and it often covers a basic living space such as bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms. This term also includes discounts for longer rental periods or for monthly renewals. Weekly Rent: Weekly rents come in two forms: fixed-term rentals (FTRs) and Leaseback agreements.</p><h2 id=apartments-for-rent-in-lansing-mi---page-5--apartmentscom>Apartments For Rent In Lansing MI - Page 5 | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apartments-for-rent-in-lansing-mi---page-5--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/oYIVDzQG1DEQ1JBC7oXg4Q5lMwVCXX_qL3_pFuK5Tv4/115/image.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Y4YR0XAiX-308r_wtwPl9gAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Apartments for Rent in Lansing MI - Page 5 | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartment Size and Size Preferences
