Apartments are a popular rental option in many cities. They offer a great deal of space, comfort, and the opportunity to be alone or in close proximity to others. However, there are a few things that landlords and tenants should keep in mind when it comes to maintenance and repairs.
Landlords should always check their apartments for any possible damage or potential issues before beginning any repairs. Repairing an issue that was not discovered during the initial inspection can void the tenant’s lease agreement. Additionally, landlords should ensure that all appliances, fixtures, and doors are working properly before beginning repairs.</p><p>Tenants should also be aware of their rights when it comes to maintenance and repairs. If they have problems with an appliance, they can bring them to the property manager or repairman for help.</p><h2 id=marcus-amp-millichap---nate-mcdaniel>Marcus & Millichap - Nate McDaniel<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#marcus-amp-millichap---nate-mcdaniel>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://mmimageservice.azurewebsites.net/api/image/property/20DF1282-7E04-4BC9-B98B-76D7E48DC9CD/M onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.uOI8hwPGLkNPGCVOIOz8qgHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="Marcus & Millichap - Nate McDaniel"><p><em>Source: marcusmillichap.com</em></p><blockquote><p>mcdaniel.</p></blockquote><p>Security in apartment complexes:
