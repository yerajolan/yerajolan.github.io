Best apartments for the budget don&rsquo;t have to be complex or luxurious. There are plenty of apartments that can fit your needs, without breaking the bank. Here are a few tips to help you find the perfect apartment for you:</p><ol><li><p>Look at what kind of living space is available in your area. Ideally, an apartment should have at least three bedrooms and two bathrooms. This way, you can afford to have some extra seating, storage, and tools around the clock – something that may not be available in a more expensive option.</p></li><li><p>Consider your needs when planning your budget. Make sure to include extras like appliances and parking in your calculations, so you&rsquo;re not overspending on an already-expensive property.</p></li><li></li></ol><h2 id=pocatello-id-apartments-for-rent---30-apartments--rentcom>Pocatello, ID Apartments For Rent - 30 Apartments | Rent.com®<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pocatello-id-apartments-for-rent---30-apartments--rentcom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://rentpath-res.cloudinary.com/t_rp,cs_tinysrgb,fl_force_strip,w_237,h_180,c_fill,q_auto,dpr_1.0,e_improve/e_unsharp_mask:50/3bec53e2d156cb7735dc0e835f1f3f33 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Mnr165o9BCKTPzOzwwnxDQAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Pocatello, ID Apartments for Rent - 30 Apartments | Rent.com®"><p><em>Source: rent.com</em></p><blockquote><p>pocatello.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a type of housing that is typically found in larger cities.
