Apartment living has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many people looking for a place to call home. However, there are a variety of different types of apartments available, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here are four key distinctions between apartments and other types of housing:</p><ol><li><p>Rentals: In most cases, apartments are rented to individuals rather than being bought outright. This means that the landlord usually pays the tenant directly – either monthly or annually – rather than providing finance or assistance in finding a lender. As a result, rentals tend to be cheaper per month than buying an apartment outright.</p></li><li><p>Size: Apartments vary in size from small to large. Most typically comprise two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms, while some can contain up to six bedrooms and bathrooms.</p></li></ol><h2 id=the-5-best-affordable-new-york-apartments-week-of-december-16>The 5 Best Affordable New York Apartments (Week Of December 16)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-5-best-affordable-new-york-apartments-week-of-december-16>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://media.timeout.com/images/101843145/image.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.EmdQNw1CkQqEDGu142zVhAHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="The 5 best affordable New York apartments (Week of December 16)"><p><em>Source: timeout.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>The disadvantages of apartment living: from the lack of privacy to cramped quarters
