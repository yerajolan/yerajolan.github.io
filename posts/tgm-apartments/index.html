Next, consider the size of your apartment. If you&rsquo;re looking for a smaller rental property, it might be easier to get a mortgage or lease with a shorter term than if you&rsquo;re looking for a larger one. Finally, make sure you have your current address and current credit score before applying for a mortgage or lease.</p><h2 id=tgm-harbor-beach---28-photos-amp-30-reviews---apartments---1721-se-17th>TGM HARBOR BEACH - 28 Photos & 30 Reviews - Apartments - 1721 SE 17th<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tgm-harbor-beach---28-photos-amp-30-reviews---apartments---1721-se-17th>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sYRwtn4O2k1_Qo_aKkSEYg/o.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.H3ubF3x6NfBh51ErxheYxgHaJ4&pid=15.1"' alt="TGM HARBOR BEACH - 28 Photos & 30 Reviews - Apartments - 1721 SE 17th"><p><em>Source: yelp.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a great way to live in a city.

When is an apartment good?
There are a lot of factors to consider when choosing an apartment, but location is usually one of the most important. Location can be determined by a variety of factors such as the price of rent, the size and shape of the apartments, and the distance from public transportation.</p><p>Some people believe that apartments in desirable locations are worth more than apartments in less desirable locations. This is because a better location often means more opportunities for activities and cultural experiences that can make up for a lower rent price.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an apartment with unique features or someone who will be living there long-term, it&rsquo;s important to look at the location before settling on any options.</p><h2 id=2-bedroom-apartment-for-sale--m-and-t>2 Bedroom Apartment For Sale – M And T<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-bedroom-apartment-for-sale--m-and-t>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.mntrealty.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Apartment-6-1-1170x600-c-center.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.7MFPsFXJ8hEatgy3gWl3LwHaDz&pid=15.1"' alt="2 Bedroom Apartment For Sale – M and T"><p><em>Source: mntrealty.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>What is an apartment?
