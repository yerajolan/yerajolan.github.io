Apartments can be either rooms or condos. Rooms are usually smaller and less luxurious than condos, but they&rsquo;re also more affordable. For example, a two-bedroom apartment might cost around $800 while a three-bedroom may cost well over $1,000. A room in an apartment is also often the perfect size for one person to sleep in.</p><h2 id=welcome-idaho-sign>Welcome Idaho Sign<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#welcome-idaho-sign>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://www.city-data.com/stock-photo/full/idaho_boise_10.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.vLtfac7AfCZxGXeAHSga4gHaFd&pid=15.1"' alt="Welcome idaho sign"><p><em>Source: city-data.com</em></p><blockquote><p>idaho boise transportation department data welcome sign shutterstock invest million.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a popular type of housing in the United States.
