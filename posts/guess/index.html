A lot of people want to find an apartment that is the perfect size for them. Depending on your needs, you may want to go with a studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom, or three-bedroom apartment. However, before you make any decisions about what size to choose, it is important to understand how the layout of an apartment will affect your sleeping habits.
