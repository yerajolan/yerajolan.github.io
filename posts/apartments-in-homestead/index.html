A few notable examples from throughout history include the Star-Kist Building in New York City, which was built in 1907 as a luxury hotel. Additionally, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in London was one of the first buildings to be occupied by tenants with apartments on top.</p><p>In recent years, apartment buildings have become even more popular, with many people looking for an affordable lifestyle closer to their work or home.</p><h2 id=dave-amp-buster039s---visit-pittsburgh>Dave & Buster's - Visit Pittsburgh<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dave-amp-buster039s---visit-pittsburgh>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/imager/files_idssasp_com/public/C32/048a7c25-af0f-4edb-9f53-43c4b4f8a7f1/9dbd34d7-f12a-426f-9bf0-36c37ec109b8_2200f99a241e55606b0e5da9ea141a39.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GGTIa4MiqD8fJCqJBReGQwHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="Dave & Buster's - Visit Pittsburgh"><p><em>Source: visitpittsburgh.com</em></p><blockquote><p>dave busters buster pittsburgh visit.</p></blockquote><p>Size: How much space should an apartment have?
