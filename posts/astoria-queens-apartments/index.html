However, there are a variety of different types of apartments available, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here are four key distinctions between apartments and other types of housing:</p><ol><li><p>Rentals: In most cases, apartments are rented to individuals rather than being bought outright. This means that the landlord usually pays the tenant directly – either monthly or annually – rather than providing finance or assistance in finding a lender. As a result, rentals tend to be cheaper per month than buying an apartment outright.</p></li><li><p>Size: Apartments vary in size from small to large.
